EU Commissioner Mairead McGuinness has defended the EU response to the crisis in Gaza and denied that Commission
President Ursula von der Leyen had made the situation more difficult with her comments.

Her comments came as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar travels to Brussels to attend a meeting
of EU leaders to discuss the huge challenges posed by two major conflicts on Europe’s
doorsteps – the ongoing war in Ukraine and the outbreak of a bloody conflict in the Middle East.

The meeting in Brussels will happen just as the Department of Foreign Affairs

has warned Irish citizens to leave Lebanon because of the highly volatile situation there.

Speaking on Newstalk radio, Ms McGuinness said that Ms von der Leyen had shown “incredible leadership” on very complex topics. She respected the President for her leadership during the pandemic and in her response to the war in Ukraine.
