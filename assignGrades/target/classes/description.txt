(Assign grades) Write a program that reads student scores, gets the best score, and
then assigns grades based on the following scheme:
Grade is A if score is >= best - 10;
Grade is B if score is >= best - 20;
Grade is C if score is >= best - 30;
Grade is D if score is >= best - 40;
Grade is F otherwise.
The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, then prompts
the user to enter all the scores, and concludes by displaying the grades. Here is
a sample run:
Enter the number of students: 4
Enter 4 scores: 40 55 70 58
org.example.Student 0 score is 40 and grade is C
org.example.Student 1 score is 55 and grade is B
org.example.Student 2 score is 70 and grade is A
org.example.Student 3 score is 58 and grade is B
