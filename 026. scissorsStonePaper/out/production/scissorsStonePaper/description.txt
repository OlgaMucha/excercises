        (Game: scissor, rock, paper) Programming Exercise 3.17 gives a program that
        plays the scissors–rock–paper game. Revise the program to let the user continuously
        play until either the user or the computer wins more than two times than its
        opponent.
        Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper.
