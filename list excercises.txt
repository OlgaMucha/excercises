002. Loting of the random color of the rainbow

003. Calculating of the umber of days in given month + year

004. There are 5 multipliction questions asked and nswer is % of good answers

005. computer lotes 3 random digits where 1 can't be 0, user enters 3 digits,
	check if all digit of both user and random are equal and in this same order.If yes - HUGE WIN!!!! $12.000!!!,
	if this same digits but different order BIG WIN!!!! $5.000!!!, if 1 digit this same You win $1000!!", otherwise no win

006. Reverse string given by user

007. Checking if the by the user entered number is in array, if yes returning the position number. If the number entered is not in the array 	returning -1



026. (Game: scissor, rock, paper) Programming Exercise 3.17 gives a program that
        plays the scissors–rock–paper game. Revise the program to let the user continuously
        play until either the user or the computer wins more than two times than its
        opponent.
        Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper.

027. Given an array of ints, we'll say that a triple is a value appearing 3 times in the array.
    Return true if the array does not contain any triples.

028. (The longest common prefix) Write a program that prompts the user to enter two
	strings and displays the largest common prefix of the two strings. Here are some
	sample runs:
Enter the first string: Welcome to C++
Enter the second string: Welcome to programming
The common prefix is Welcome to
Enter the first string: Atlanta
Enter the second string: Macon
Atlanta and Macon have no common prefix

029.  (Math: pentagonal numbers) A pentagonal number is defined as n(3n-1)/2 for
    n = 1, 2, . . ., and so on. Therefore, the first few numbers are 1, 5, 12, 22, ... .
    Write a method with the following header that returns a pentagonal number:
    public static int getPentagonalNumber(int n)
    For example, getPentagonalNumber(1) returns 1 and getPentagonalNumber(
    2) returns 5. Write a test program that uses this method to display the first
    100 pentagonal numbers with 10 numbers on each line. Use the %7d format to
    display each number.

030. (Sum the digits in an integer) Write a method that computes the sum of the digits
in an integer. Use the following method header:
public static int sumDigits(long n)
For example, sumDigits(234) returns 9 (= 2 + 3 + 4)

031. (Check password) Some Websites impose certain rules for passwords. Write a
        method that checks whether a string is a valid password. Suppose the password
        rules are as follows:
        ■■ A password must have at least eight characters.
        ■■ A password must contain only letters and digits.
        ■■ A password must contain at least two digits.
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter a password and displays Valid
        Password if the rules are followed, or Invalid Password otherwise.

032. (Assign grades) Write a program that reads student scores, gets the best score, and
	then assigns grades based on the following scheme:
	Grade is A if score is Ú best -10;
	Grade is B if score is Ú best -20;
	Grade is C if score is Ú best -30;
	Grade is D if score is Ú best -40;
	Grade is F otherwise.
	The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, then prompts
	the user to enter all of the scores, and concludes by displaying the grades.

033. (BinaryFormatException)
	Implement the bin2Dec method
	to throw a BinaryFormatException if the string is not a binary string. Define
	a custom exception called BinaryFormatException. Implement the bin2Dec
	method to throw a BinaryFormatException if the string is not a binary string.

034. (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException)
	Write a program that meets the following requirements:
	■■ Creates an array with 100 randomly chosen integers.
	■■ Prompts the user to enter the index of the array, then displays the corresponding
	element value. If the specified index is out of bounds, display the
	message "Out of Bounds".

035. (Count characters, words, and lines in a file) Write a program that will count
	the number of characters, words, and lines in a file. Words are separated by
	whitespace characters. The file name should be passed as a command-line
	argument, as shown:

	example output:
	c://excercises/java1 Welcome1.java
	File Welcome1 has
	170 characters
	22 words
	6 lines

036. 100 random integers entered in the txt file

037. (Replace text) ReplaceText.java, gives a program that replaces
	text in a source file and saves the change into a new file. Revise the program to
	save the change into the original file. For example, invoking
	java Exercise12_16 file oldString newString
	replaces oldString in the source file with newString.

038. (Data sorted?) Write a program that reads the strings from file SortedStrings.txt
	and reports whether the strings in the files are stored in increasing order. If the
	strings are not sorted in the file, it displays the first two strings that are out of
	the order.
